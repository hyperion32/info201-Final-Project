All sample weights that fell above the selected percentile were trimmed to the selected percentile and the trimmed difference was evenly distributed among all of the non-trimmed sample weights. The trimmed, non-response adjusted sample weights were then calibrated using first the 7-category Hispanic Background distribution and then the 12-category age group/gender distribution using the 2010 Decennial Census. Finally, these calibrated, trimmed, non-response adjusted sample weights were normalized using the weighted mean divided by weighted standard deviation of the entire HCHS/SOL sample to normalize the expanded calibrated sample weights (WEIGHT_Final_Norm_Overall). This final sample weight variable is used for analyses purposes only.",numeric,"","","","",""
